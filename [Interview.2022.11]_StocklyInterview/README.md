# Stockly Entry Test

# How to do the test

 - All the exercises are in the directory `exercises`.
 - Each file is an exercice.
 - Each file should export a function.
 - Exercices are sorted by order of difficulty. 0 is the easiest.
 - Only the files in the directory `exercises` will be read.
 - You have 45 minutes to do the tests and push your commits (before 10:04:22).
 - We strongly advise you to code only where it's written `// Write your code here`.

# How you are evaluated

 - You will be judged on the state of `origin/master` at 10:04:22.
 - You have all the validations in the directory `validations`.
 - All your functions must pass all the tests (script `npm run start`).
 - The test framework is [jest](https://jestjs.io/).

# Helpers

 - Run `npm install` to be able to run helper scripts.
 - Run `npm run start` to check your answers.
 - Run `npm run validate ${nameOfValidationFile}` to check only one answer.
 - Run `npm run hack` to see if you might have hacked the test.
 - If your answers are correct, tests will run quickly. Tests running slowly means that some of your answers are not correct.

# Further notice

 - We will use the last commit on the repository at 10:04:22. Don't forget to push your code!
 - The exercises take around 33 minutes to complete. The 12 other are for git manipulations.
 - Please do not change the file names, if you do and it doesn't work then too bad for you.
 - No human will read your code, code as you like we just want it to work.
 - You can try to hack the test but if you fail or are caught, you'll have a grade of 0.
 - Any modifications to any files not in `exercises` will be considered as cheating.
 - It is strictly forbidden to overwrite the initial commit, this will be considered as cheating.
 - Test file hackme.validation.js is built not to pass, you'll win extra points if you make it pass anyway.

Good luck!
